springboot schedular IQA
--------------------------------

consider that for a spring boot application I need configured execute for every one minute starting at 10am and ending at 1059am 1. what is the right code to configure this scheduler? 2.what is the right configuration to configure a schedular to execute a task for every second when the application startup?

1. Scheduler that runs every 1 minute starting at 10:00 AM and ending at 10:59 AM

@Component
public class MyScheduledTask {

    // This will run every 1 minute between 10:00 AM and 10:59 AM
    @Scheduled(cron = "0 * 10 * * *")
    public void runTaskEveryMinute() {
        System.out.println("Running task at: " + java.time.LocalTime.now());
    }
}

0 * 10 * * * means:

0 seconds

* every minute

10 the hour (i.e., 10 AM)

* every day

* every month

* every day of the week


2. Scheduler that runs every 1 second after application startup
You can create another method like this:

java
Copy
Edit
@Component
public class StartupTaskRunner {

    // This will run every 1 second continuously
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000) // 1000 ms = 1 second
    public void runTaskEverySecond() {
        System.out.println("Running task every second: " + java.time.LocalTime.now());
    }
}
