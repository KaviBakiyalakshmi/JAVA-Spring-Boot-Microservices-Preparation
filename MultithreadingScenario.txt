1.Suppose There are three #Threads T1, T2 and T3. T1 is responsible for some environment setup. T2 and T3 are the #business logic executing threads. T2 and T3 can only start once T1 has finished its execution and #environment is ready.

Approach 1
  make t2 and t3 sleep for sometime
  Issuess facing this approach
--------------------------------
  t2 and t3 having wait for long time

Approach 2
  isAlive method to check the status
 t2 and t2 you can write 
  while(t1.isAlive()){}
  Issues---cpu run agite irukum t2,t3

Approach 3

  t2 and t3 you can write
   t1.join();
   t1.join();


2. countdownLatch--- question we have 5 threads we need to go one place then run the all thread parallel 

use join method for waiting for the pingpoint but it will run sequence 
we want parallel

who all are come to the pingpoint he is putting msg (countdown decrasing the value 

CountDownLatch obj=new CountDownLatch(5);
//code//
thread.start();
obj.countDown();
}
obj.await (until 0)
