string time complexity
-------------------------

String s1="String can't modify"
string s2="strings are immutable"
s1+s1;

bigo(n2)

Dis of string
---------------

if you want to add n characters is a string you are having a complexity of n square

solution
---------

we can append the n items instead of creating new string
